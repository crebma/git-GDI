##  using git clone


In your terminal, `cd` to a directory in which you'd like to work.
```bash
$ cd ~ #will put you in your home directory
$ cd Documents #(or where ever)
$ git clone https://github.com/kroysemaj/git-demo.git
```

(you may be asked to enter your github login credentials, that's fine)
