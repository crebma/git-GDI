##  de-gitting git-demo

We're going to remove the `.git` folder to demonstrate how to create a git repo from scratch and add it to github

<br>

First we have to get rid of that pesky `.git` folder. Easy peasy!

<br>

```bash
$ ls -al #shows all folders and files, even hidden
$ rm -rf .git #removes .git and all its contents
```

<br>

Your terminal might have changed a little when you did that. It's okay it just means it worked.
