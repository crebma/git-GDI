##  using git log

Using this command is very simple.

```bash
$ cd ~/gdi-git #back in our class project folder
$ git log
```
Pressing enter will allow you to see more of the log line by line.

If there is more stuff than will fit one screen, pressing return will reveal more.

What is not obvious is how to exit the log. Press `Q`.
