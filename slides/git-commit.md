#### `[new command]`
##  git commit

Once you’ve got code you want to keep (i.e. staged) you can commit that change and create a kind of anchor point that you can build from or return to if needed.

>ProTip: Don’t forget the -m to add your commit message. If you forget it, git will throw you into VIM and that will ruin your whole day.
