#### `Develop It!`
##  Practice Working on a team

1. Other team members: Clone the team project to your computer.
1. Everyone: Take a look at these [lyrics](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/wiki/Code_Monkey/Lyrics).
1. Divvy up the lyrics into 4-5 line chunks and distribute them randomly among the team.
1. Your task is to add all of the song's lyrics in the correct order ot the `lyrics.txt` file.
1. Resist the urge to wait for your teammates to push their code or leave large open space between the stanzas. The *goal* is to have merge conflicts and to resolve them.
