##  creating a new repo

Now that we are ready to start using git, we need a project to use it on. We wil create all the files and folders we need using the command line.

<br>

This is exactly the procedure you would go through to create a new repo from scratch on a new project. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

<br>

Choose a directory where you would like to keep all your work from today. (Here's a suggestion, Documents/) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
```bash
cd Documents
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

<br>

Now create a new directory for all the projects from this class. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
```bash
mkdir gdi-git-class
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
