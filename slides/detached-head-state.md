##  detached HEAD state

When you checkout a commit you enter what's called 'detached HEAD state'. This is kind of a read-only mode. More specifically, you can't do any commits in this state as you're not on a branch (more on that later). So any changes you make while checking out this commit will be lost unless you stash them or move them to another branch.
