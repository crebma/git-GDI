##  what is a branch?

So what is a branch anyway? Think of your project as a tree, the main course of development is its trunk. Smaller offshoots of development such as new features, bug fixes, or whatever can be developed on a branch (off the main trunk but conflicting with the main) and integrated when needed.

We will deal with branches in more detail later.
