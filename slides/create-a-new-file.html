<h2>create a new file</h2>

<p>Once you have your first commit, you can change or add new files to the project. Let's add a new file to this project called < your-name >.js</p>
<p> (ex. james.js)</p>

<br>

<p class="terminal"><code>$ touch james.js</code></p>

<br>

<p><code>touch</code> is a command that creates a new file. Just give it the name of the file you want to create (including the extension). </p>
