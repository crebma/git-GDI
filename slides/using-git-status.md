##  using git status

After the file has been added, you can check your status to see that git can see that the file has been created but it is not being currently tracked.

<br/>

`$ git status`

<br/>

You should get a listing of any untracked files in the repo. Your new file should be in that list. If itâ€™s not, raise your hand.
