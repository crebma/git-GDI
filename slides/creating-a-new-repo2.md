##  creating a new repo

Now we need to change our directory into the new folder we created
```bash
$ cd gdi-git
```
>ProTip: Once you type 'gdi-' hit tab and your console should finish the rest for you. Magic!!

Okay we have a folder for our class but we're going to be making several projects in this class. So let's create another directory for this first project. Then we'll make a file that will be our first project's source. First let's make a javascript file. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

```bash
$ mkdir git-cmd-demos
$ cd git-cmd-demos
$ touch helloWorld.js
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
