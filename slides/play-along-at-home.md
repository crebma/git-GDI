##  Play along at home

From here on I will be spoon-feeding you terminal commands

When I do, they will look like this:

(The dollar sign ($) is your terminal's prompt. You don't need to type that. That's just a convention.)

```bash
$ type this into your terminal exactly
$ also this #not this
```

When I give you more than one command, you will enter each command and press enter at the end of each line
