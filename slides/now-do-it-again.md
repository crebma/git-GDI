#### Exercise Time!
##  Time for our first Challenge!

### Setup:

Create a new folder in our class folder

```bash
$ cd .. #navigate up the directory tree one level
```

You should be in the `gdi-git` directory, from here. You can check this by using the `pwd` command

```bash
$ pwd #print working directory
```

You should see something like this...
```bash
/Users/jyork/Documents/git/gdi-git
```
As long as you have that `gdi-git` on the end you're in good shape
