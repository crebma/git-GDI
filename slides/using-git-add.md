##  using git add


To add a new file to your git repo, you would
use the git add < filepath > command.

<br>

```bash
$ git add index.html
$ git add jquery-demo.js
$ git add main.css
```

<br>

If you check your status again you should see that the file is now being tracked and is ready to be committed.
