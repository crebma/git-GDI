##  create a new file

Once you have created your first commit, you can change or add new files to the project.
Add a file called < your-name >.js

(ex. james.js)

<br>
```bash
$ touch james.js
```
<br>

`touch` is a command that creates a new file. Just give it the name of the file you want to create (including the extension).
